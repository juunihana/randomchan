modular imageboard
    user can create configurations which consist of tags subscriptions, modules with different boards on left and right panels (screen split)
    each configuration is open and is assigned a hashcode which according to user's decision can be stored in cookie or saved manually by user
    users can share configurations
    configurations not used in two weeks (?) are removed from DB
    configurations modules:
        picture packs
        subcriptions

this can be useful - taken if I'm intrested in #embedded and #nature and want to watch /b/ simultaneously but I don't wan't to see #nsfw threads I can set up configuration according to my needs
e.g. I will have /b/ on the left side of my screen and embedded/nature threads on the right side which are updated in realtime (and I can configure whether updates are RT)
and I can share my configuration to anyone who intrested in these things as well, but it will be completely anonymous

another module is chat - users can communicate using their hashcodes therefore chatting is anonymous
